# E-Commerce AI Project

My graduation project focused on visual search technology for e-commerce platforms using artificial intelligence.

## About This Project

I developed this project as part of my graduation requirements. It enables users to search for products by uploading images, utilizing advanced image processing and AI technologies to find visually similar items in an e-commerce database.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd ecommerce-ai/backend

# Create a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# For Linux/MacOS:
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd ecommerce-ai/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Backend Server

```bash
cd ecommerce-ai/backend
# Make sure virtual environment is active
python app.py
```

### Frontend Application

```bash
cd ecommerce-ai/frontend
npm start
```

## Technical Architecture

My application consists of two main components:

1. **Backend (Flask)**: Handles image processing, AI model integration, and API services
2. **Frontend (React)**: Provides a responsive and intuitive user interface

## Key Features

- Visual search capability to find products based on image similarity
- Category-based filtering for improved search results
- AI-powered product recommendation system
- Responsive design for various device types

## Project Status

This project is part of my academic work and is currently in development.
