# Project Notes

This file contains personal notes about the development of my E-Commerce AI Project.

## Development Environment Setup

These are steps I followed to set up my development environment:

1. Set up the GitHub repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tahaozcn/CCGAI.git
   cd CCGAI
   ```

2. Configure development environments:
   - Backend setup (Flask, TensorFlow, etc.)
   - Frontend setup (React, npm packages)

## Personal Workflow

My typical workflow when developing new features:

1. Update local repository with latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Implement and test changes
   - Test backend APIs
   - Verify frontend functionality

3. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement feature X"
   ```

4. Push changes to repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Coding Conventions

Standards I try to follow in my code:

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Document functions and classes
- Write unit tests when possible

### JavaScript/React Code
- Follow ESLint conventions
- Create reusable components
- Design with mobile responsiveness in mind

## Future Improvements

Ideas for future development:
- Implement user authentication
- Add product comparison feature
- Enhance recommendation algorithm
- Optimize for mobile devices
